            <p>My name is Sonia.  I am a freshman at the University of Nebraska at Omaha (UNO) .  I am a returning adult learner trying to earn a second BA - in Info  Assurance.  I already have a BA in English and work as a retail clerk at a chain store.  I hope that UNO will lead me to better prospects in the future. 
            </p>
            <p>I am an anime and RPG fan.  I used to watch subbed anime online, read translated scans online, and go to conventions.  Now I restrain myself to  watching other people playthrough RPGs on Youtube and reading fanfiction.  This is due to how distracted I would let myself get and how little work I would get done.
            </p>
            <p>My favorite RPGs are the Final Fantasy series, though I have a soft spot for the nostalgia of Pokemon.  My favorite anime tends toward the supernatural genre, with some romantic and slice of life.  Though I often enjoy fanfictions of those games and animes more than the original works.  Particularly fanfics that explore character development and world building - which are often lacking, given the medium.

            <p>I have already earned an English BA and a minor in Business Administration, and am currently an undecided major in <abbr title="University of Nebraska at Omaha">UNO's</abbr> College of <abbr title="Information Science and Technology">IS&amp;T</abbr>.  Though undecided at the moment I am leaning toward earning a BS in Information Assurance (IA) and hope to gain pratical experience in the field while still in school.

        <div id="rec">   
            <h1>Recreation </h1>
            <p>In my free time, I read fanfiction online - I have favorite authors and favorite source materials that I usually check first for updates.  Right now I am reading fanfics about the Korean Manhwa "The Gamer" and before that I perused the Japanese manga "Katekyo Hitman Reborn."
            </p>
            <p>
            When I'm not reading fanfics, I enjoy going onto YouTube and watching RPG playthroughs.  Usually I watch Final Fantasy playthroughs, but sometimes I watch the playthrough of a game series that I hear about to see if I like it and it's related works.  I did that for playthroughs of "Vampire: The Masquerade" and "Mass Effect."
