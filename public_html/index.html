		<h1>My CIST 1300 Assignments</h1>

		<h2>Loki Main Page</h2>
		<p>The <a href="http://loki.ist.unomaha.edu/1300" target="_blank">main page</a> for the loki server that the students of CIST 1300 (and CSCI 2850) use to practice classwork. 
		The current assignment, a7, requires this link to be included.
		</p>

		<h2>Assignment 1</h2>
		<p>The first assignment was just to set up a <a href="a1" target="_blank">web space.</a> 
		Professor Blackmore had us put a temporary home page up to fill it. 
		The temp page had three random things with a vaildator badge at the bottom.
		</p>

		<h2>Assignment 2</h2>
		<p>This assignment was to create <a href="a2" target="_blank">an actual webpage and incorporate images.</a>
		We got rid of the three random things and replaced them with personal information, pictures and several quotes.
		</p>

		<h2>Assignment 3</h2>
		<p>In this assignment, we were to create a table containing our daily schedule on a new page. 
		Then we linked that page to our classes' webpages, our favorite sites, and to the webpage we made in our previous assignment.
		So, it looked <a href="a3" target="_blank">exactly like assignment 2 except for a link at the bottom:</a> the link then would open up to the rest of assignment 3.
		</p>

		<h2>Assignment 4</h2>
		<p><a href="a4" target="_blank">Assignment 4</a> started us on CSS styling. We added on to our previous assignments by incorporating music.
		We made yet another page and used inline styling to embed videos and music from Youtube and archive.org. 
		This page was also linked to the other two pages through linis at the bottom of the pages.
		</p>

		<h2>Assignment 5</h2>
		<p><a href="a5" target="_blank">This assignment</a> took us further into CSS. 
		We deleted a great deal of the inline styling from the previous assignment in order to apply external styling. 
		We created an external file that held the styling rules we wanted to be applied to the webpages we already made in the previous assignments.
		</p>

		<h2>Assignment 14 and the Project</h2>
		<p>In the current assignment, which is actually assignment 7, we were told to put the placeholder we made for Assignment 1 on the webpage for now.
		Likely it will be replaced when we actually get to <a href="a14" target="_blank">Assignment 14.</a>
		Similarly, <a href="project" target="_blank">the Project</a> will actually be addressed later - we still need to study Perl before we get to it.
