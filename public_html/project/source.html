            <h1>The Source Material</h1>
            <p>
            This subculture is based on the fandom of anime/manga, a pop culture phenomenon from Japan.
            <br>
            <q>Anime</q> is, to someone not part of the fandom, Japanese cartoons.  
            <br>
            <q>Manga</q> is, to someone not part of the fandom, Japanese comics.
            <br><br> 
            To someone who IS interested in the fandom, let's instead use the definition <q>animated productions (anime)/graphic novels 			(manga) done in a distinctive art style.</q>  
            <br>
            Though <q>distinctive</q> might be the wrong word, as the style has very loose limits: large eyes (in proportion to the rest of 		the face), usually minimally drawn noses, and usually exotically 		colored hair and eyes.  
            <br>
            In fact, different artists/studios in the industry will often develop their own style within those broad limits. 
            <br>
            Anime/manga has become popular enough that there are works widely considered anime/manga that are non-Japanese in origin 			due to the heavy influence & inspiration they take from 			conventional anime/manga.  Though actually labeling such works 			as <q>anime/manga</q> is contested among fans.
            </p>

            <h1>Visual Devices</h1>
            <p>
            The artists of anime/manga often use visual cues to signal what's going on.  Though since different artists have their own 	styles, different works may or may not conform to different extents.  In general though (and this list is by no means complete):
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li><u>Emotes</u>: characters often react in an exaggerated or otherwise visible way, since the medium doesn't have the level of detail to allow conveyance of emotion with subtle facial shifts</li> 

                <li>Sweatdrop - a single, prominent bead/drop of sweat on a character's head.  Denotes embarrassment, exasperation, confusion.  Basically, a <q>Huh?</q>
                <br>
                (Actual perspiration is denoted by smaller sweatdrops dispersed on the head)</li>

                <li>Anger tic/veins on face - a rounded cross outline, often red, can also be in the form of a pulsing vein on the head.  Denotes anger, irritation, or frustration.  Basically, someone 			going <q>Grr...</q> (Some art styles use huffs of air to show anger)</li>

                <li>Blush - red/pink tint or hatch marks on the cheeks or on the nose.  Denotes embarrassment, romantic feelings, and sometimes strong emotions (like the reddening of cheeks with an onslaught of tears)</li>

                <li>Oval blush marks - if the character has pink/red marks on their cheeks all the time, they just have rosy cheeks</li>

                <li>Hatch marks on the face (not red/pink) - usually indicates a bruise or dirt after the character has been hit</li>

                <li>Nosebleed - denotes perverted thoughts, especially when accompanied by blushing cheeks</li>

                <li>Vertical lines on the head (usually blue, purple, or just black) - denotes disgust, shock, horror, depression, or weariness</li>

                <li>Snot bubble from the nose - denotes that the character is sleeping</li>

                <li>Heart-eyes - denotes a crush</li>

                <li>Doe-eyes - may also denote a crush, but more often used to portray a pleading expression</li>

                <li>Spiral eyes - denotes dizziness or confusion</li>

                <li>X eyes - denotes unconsciousness or otherwise mentally absent</li>

                <li>Pupilless/no reflection of light eyes - denotes delirium, insanity, mind control, death, or otherwise mentally absent			<br>
                (Reflection of light in eyes is an art convention prevalent in anime)</li>
            </ul>
