            <h1>A Peek into Online Anime/Manga Geekdom</h1>
            <p>
            This website is made with the purpose of informing a general audience about the online subculture of self-identified anime/manga geeks.  
            <br>
            Most geek sites are created by those already in that subculture as a forum for others like them and assume that visitors to the site are already part of their subculture and know what to expect.
            Or can figure it out after sticking around after a while.
            <br>
            Not this one - this website has explanations aimed at people who aren't already a part of this field of interest.
            </p>

            <br><br>

            <h1>The Online Subculture</h1>
            <p>
            Keep in mind that we are talking about the Internet - new ideas, memes, and fanspeak terms come up all the time.
            <br>
            And this is meant to be Anime/Manga 101: a very general overview.  So this is not completely up to date nor does it go into particulars.
            </p>

            <br><br>
            <br><br>

            <h1>Geek, not Nerd</h1>
            <p>
            Language changes over time and terms mean something a little different every few years.
            The current meaning of "geek" and "nerd" by self-identified geeks and nerds are:
            <br>
            A "geek" is someone who is fascinated by a very specific field.  This field can be computers, games, art, a TV series, anything.
            <br>
            A "nerd" is someone who is highly intelligent and tends towards introversion.
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <br><br>
