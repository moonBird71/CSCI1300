            <h1>Fanworks</h1>
            <p>
            Fans of anime/manga are widespread and in great enough numbers to qualify being called a sub-culture in their own right.  The fans formed clubs revolving around their mutual interests, wrote their own stories, created their own artwork, and eventually organized the large gatherings of fans known as anime conventions
            <br><br>
            Anime/manga fans will often take up some kind of fan work and share the product of their work on the Internet with other fans.  
            <br><br>
            This list is by no means complete:
            <br><br>
            <b>Fan fiction (FanFics)</b> is written fiction based on an original work of fiction (called <q>canon</q>) written by fans of the work.  Fanfics are often written to continue the story, to add new elements/settings/characters into the story, to get their favorite couple together, and more.
            <br>
            Most fanfic writers are amateurs and often write for wish fulfillment, leading to fanfiction getting a reputation for awful writing (but there are some fics that are just as good, maybe better, than the original work)
            <br>
            Creators of the original work react in various ways to fanfiction of their work, some even restricting their fans from doing so or imposing rules on what fans can do with their work (especially when confronted with Rule 34 of the internet: if it exists, there is a porn version of it)
            <br>
            Fanfics have become perhaps the most widespread form of fan labor due to the Internet.  The currently largest source of fanfics is fanfiction.net, which is a site with some content restrictions (against MA and NC-17 rated material, against some forms of writing, and guidelines about writing fics on source materials with authors that have imposed restrictions).  A newer site, Archive of Our Own (AO3) has started gaining popularity as a site with less content restrictions and thus as a place for more mature material. 
            <br><br>
            For a brief overview of different types of fanfictions (and this list is by no means complete):
            <br><br>
            <i>For want of a nail</i> fics start with a single change from the 	original story, which then causes a ripple effect leading to big changes
            <br>
            <i>Crossover</i> fics feature characters/settings from two (or more) different series/storylines.  Commonly, popular characters from one 	franchise appear in another series' world.  Or the settings of two franchises are written as being in the same world all along.
            <br>
            <i>Drabbles</i> are more like ficlets - short pieces rather than full narratives.  A drabble may be a series of ficlets or a single one.
            <br>
            <i>Slash</i> fics romantically pair characters of the same gender.  Usually the term is used to refer to male/male pairings, with the term <q>femslash</q> used to specify female/female pairings.  This is especially prevalent in works with a particularly uneven gender ratio.
            <br>
            <i>Crack</i> fic is a story with a premise and events that are (since its fiction, we won't use the word <q>impossible</q>) highly improbable, even in the original work (which is usually set in a fictional world with flexible laws of physics).  Often humorous, irrational, and even random.
            <br>
            <i>Recursive</i> fics are fanfics of fanfics.  When a fanfic becomes so popular with the fanbase of the original work, that readers write fanfics of that fanfic
            <br>
            <i>Alternate Universe (AU)</i> fics are fanfics in which the writer has changed a fundamental aspect of the original story.  This can range from changing a character's background story to setting the characters in a world with a different set of rules than the original work
            <br>
            <i>Deconstruction</i> fics pick apart the original work.  They often take an aspect of the original story or a hole in the plot to its logical end.  It might be the rules of the setting, the traits of a character, a hole in an otherwise consistent plot, or some aspect that was glossed over in the original work.
            <br>
            <i>Peggy Sue</i> fics have a character, usually around the end of the series or after some critical junction in the storyline, go back in time.  Often to set right something that went wrong (in the eyes of the fanfic writer) or to have the character relive their life with more experienced eyes/higher skills.
            <br>
            <i>Lemon</i> fics have explicit sexual content.  This can range from fanfics that have legitimate plotlines that happen to follow the characters while they're in the bedroom, to fics that are pretty much porn and don't bother with having a plot
            <br>
            <i>Lime</i> fics are similar to lemon fics but less explicit.  Soft-core.
            <br><br>
            <b><q>Doujinshi</q></b> is Japanese for <q>amateur publication</q> and refers to published fanwork, usually in the form of manga written and drawn by one or a group of fans working together.  
            <br>
            Being self-published, and thus less censored, doujinshi is often associated with sexual imagery and depictions of transgressions (Hard-core).  Though this is not necessarily true of the medium as a whole.  Another popular form of doujinshi, though less so than fan-made manga, is fan-made games.  
            <br>
            Though less so in the west then in Japan, doujinshi is how many anime/manga artists establish themselves in the industry before writing their own original works.  And it's not uncommon for the original creator of an ongoing series to take inspiration from doujinshi of their works.
            <br><br>
            <b>Fan-art</b> is like fanfics but pictures rather than words.  A lot of anime, in order to produce a series easily, is meant to be easy to draw.  So it's common for fans to try their hand at it.  Fan-art differs from doujinshi in that doujinshi is in the format of a story.
            <br>
            Particularly common are fans drawing gender-flipped versions of characters, images of their favorite pairings that may or may not have happened in the original work, images of favorite characters drawn to be more attractive, and Rule 34 of the Internet (fan-made porn).
            <br>
            A good site to find fan-art is <i>DeviantArt</i>.  DeviantArt is a site displaying the artwork of its users.  The most common being drawn sketches, but the site also features digital art, photos, paintings, and more.  The site does delete art that is too risque, but since <q>art</q> is subjective, there's quite a bit that avoid deletion. 
            <br>
            There is also <i>Pixiv</i>, a Japanese online community that displays its users' artwork.  It has less censorship but is limited to drawings and literature.
            <br>
            Another site is <i>ConceptArt.org</i>, a nonprofit company site populated by more professional artists.  Due to its professional users, the site has a reputation for being critical and having high standards for what art is posted on it.
            <br><br>
            <b>Anime Music Videos (AMVs)</b> are fanmade videos made from clips of anime and set to music.  So: they're like music videos featuring anime characters.  
            <br>
            AMV contests are a common feature of anime/manga conventions and fans will put their work on <i>YouTube</i> and <i>AnimeMusicVideos.org</i>.
            <br><br>
