            <p>
            <b>Conventions</b> are gatherings of fans of anime/manga.  These 	gatherings are hosted annually at convention centers, hotels, college 	campuses and usually lasting multiple days (usually over the weekend) 	they feature various activities, panels (discussions), contests, and 	fan-made products for sale.  Bigger conventions can also feature 		industry artists, publishers, and studios presenting their work to their 	audience.
            <br><br>
            Prevalent at conventions is <b>Cosplay</b>.  The word comes from 	<q>costume play</q> and is when cosplayers wear costumes of a character 	- usually from anime/manga, a game, a TV show, or some other media with 	a visual element.  Though cosplayers may also cosplay a character of 	their own design. 
            <br><br> 
            <!--find cosplay resource: a site or a list of orgs
            -->
            Cosplayers often network, creating a subculture, particularly at 	conventions where they wear the result of their labor and where there 	are often cosplay competitions.
            <br><br>
            Of course there are the Internet memes Rule 63 and Rule 34 of the 	Internet.  Rule 63 states that any given character will be depicted with 	their gender switched.  And Rule 34 states that there will be a skimpy 	version.
            <br><br>
            <!--add in info on those conventions
            -->
            For conventions in Omaha (NE), there are Anime NebrasKon and 	CONgregation, both of which have not yet set their schedule for 2016.
